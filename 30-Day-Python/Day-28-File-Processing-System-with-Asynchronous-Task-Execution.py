##################################################################################################################
Breakdown of the Example:
Context Manager (open_file):

The @contextmanager decorator is used to simplify resource management (in this case, managing file opening and closing).
Decorator (log_execution_time):

The log_execution_time decorator is used to log how long an asynchronous function takes to execute. It's useful for profiling.
Custom Exception (FileProcessingError):

Custom exceptions allow for more specific error handling. Here, we use it to signal when a file is missing.
Asynchronous Function (process_file):

We use asyncio for asynchronous tasks (e.g., simulating time-consuming file processing with await asyncio.sleep()). This makes it possible to handle tasks concurrently without blocking the main thread.
Generator (read_file_in_chunks):

The generator read_file_in_chunks reads a file in chunks. This is memory-efficient because it doesnâ€™t load the entire file into memory at once.
Metaclass (FileProcessorMeta):

A metaclass is used to dynamically add a method to the FileProcessor class. This demonstrates the power of metaclasses for class customization.
How It Works:
The main() function tests various features by creating a FileProcessor object, processing files, and reading them in chunks.
It also demonstrates asynchronous file processing and logging with decorators.
This code combines several advanced Python concepts into a practical example, simulating a real-world file processing scenario. You can easily modify this script to fit more specific use cases (e.g., file transformations, API integrations, etc.).
